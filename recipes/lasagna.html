    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Oh to be young and full of hope.</p>
    <p>A mentor of mine once told me that
        his muse was an orange tabby cat whose palate
        was so refined that only the finest of pasta cakes
        could sate his appetite. This is that recipe. Yeet yah.
    </p>

        <li>pasta sheet</li>
        <li>tomato sauce</li>
        <li>ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>basil <i>(optional)</i></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the pasta sheets in heavily salted water for 5 to 6 minutes until <i>al dente</i>.</li>
