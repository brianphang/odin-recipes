#This is my first HTML page
Things I learned:
<!> = basic html page info can be immediately included
<head>: header
<body>: body
<strong> = <b>
<em> = <i>
<p> = paragraph
<ol> = ordered list
<ul> = unordered list
<li> = list elements
<a href=""> = clickable link either absolute or relative
    ex. absolute link: protocol://domain/path
    ex. relative link: ./
<img src="" alt=""> = image source; alternative name
../ = parent directory
